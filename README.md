Treehouse Project #9

This project's goal is to create an image gallery using React and the Flickr API.

This project focuses on using create-react-app to help set up a React development
workspace quickly.

The learning objectives of this project are to create a better understanding of
creating modern single page applications using reusable components in React.

To use this project file, you must file install all dependencies by running "npm
install."

You must also include a .config.js file within the src directory. Within That
file, you must export apiKey which should contain an API key for Flickr.
