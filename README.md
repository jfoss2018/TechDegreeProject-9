# TechDegreeProject-9

This project introduces React as a powerful front-end library/framework for building SPAs. In addition to working with JSX to render the virtual DOM, this project includes requesting images from the Flickr API using the Fetch API.

### What does it do?

This app allows the user to request images from Flickr using preset search criteria or a search box for custom search criteria. The gallery will display up to 24 images if they are available on the response.

### Additional Project Info for Grading

This project's goal is to create an image gallery using React and the Flickr API.

This project focuses on using create-react-app to help set up a React development
workspace quickly.

The learning objectives of this project are to create a better understanding of
creating modern single page applications using reusable components in React.

To use this project file, you must file install all dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

You will also need to include a ".config.js" file within the src directory. Within That
file, you must include:

```
const apiKey = [   Your API Key Here   ];
export default apiKey;
```
